          <h3 class="my-3">Project Description</h3>
          <p>Tiny Toyfare is a fast-paced tower defence game that embodies two children playing with their toys and their imagination. 
            Defend your candy from the incomming dinosaurs using the different towers and squads to create an impenetrable defence! </p>
          <h3 class="my-3">My Position: Programmer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Made in Unreal Blueprints in one semester</li>
            <li>Created tower AI using arrays and trigger collisions.</li>
            <li>Programmed upgrades, including adding and removing static mesh "parts" when upgraded.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="my-3">Post Mortem</h3>
          <h6 class="my-4">What Went Right</h6>
          <p>The team had a very clear vision of what the end goal of this project would look like. 
            From the very beginning we all knew the exact number, type, and look of all of the games towers, squads, and enemies. 
            This allowed us to very quickly build a prototype and beging balancing both the towers and enemies.</p>
          <h6 class="my-4">What Went Wrong</h6>
          <p>Even with a clear vision and quick prototyping the team suffered from a few communication issues coupled with slow completion of documentation. 
            This created a few evenings where focus was lost on the project and lead to very severe "crunch time" nights before deadlines.</p>
          <h6 class="my-4">What I Learned Going Forward</h6>
          <p>I leared from this project that even with a crystal clear vision, communication can completely derail even the most well fleshed out project. 
            Going forward, I've made it very imperative to make sure that logs of any work I do are concise, detailed, and everyone on the team is notified of any newly included systems as soon as possible.</p>
