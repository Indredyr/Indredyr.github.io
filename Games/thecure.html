          <h3 class="my-3">Post Mortem</h3>
          <h6 class="my-4">What Went Right</h6>
          <p>The team had extremely strong communication through the project. 
            Deadlines were very clearly laid out at the beginning of the week, systems were tested, and feedback was given in sometimes less than twenty four hours after an update was pushed. 
            The programming team was extremely helpful with tutorials and side by side help with any problems any of us had.</p>
          <h6 class="my-4">What Went Wrong</h6>
          <p>My lack of knowledge on the C# front was a bit of a hinderance on this project which lead me to very closely make most of my deadlines due to needing small amounts of help from the team and some time in tutorials.</p>
          <h6 class="my-4">What I Learned Going Forward</h6>
          <p>My learning from this project comes from former team I was leading before joining Plus Games.
             Originally, my team had set out to make a 2D platformer and after many missed deadlines unianimously decided to disband and join Plus Games. 
             From this, I learned that the workload of a 2-D game is much different than that of a 3-D game. 
             Animations and character designs take much longer and require much more effort to stay closer to the art style of the project. 
             Scope also played a big factor in the decision to disband. We realized as the decision was made, that the current scope of our project was to large for the amount of members on the team. 
             Going forward, I've learned how to better assess my team and understand how scope can effect a project as well as some of the warning signs that can show when the scope creates to large a workload.</p>
